Bollinger Bandit Pseudocode
    LiqDay is initially set to 50
    upBand = Average(Close,50) + StdDev(Close,50) *1.25
    dnBand = Average(Close,50) - StdDev(Close,50) *1.25
    rocCalc = Close of today - Close of thirty days ago
    Set liqLength to 50
    If rocCalc is positive, a long position will be initiated when
    today's market action >= upBand
    If rocCalc is negative, a short position will be initiated when
    today's market action <= dnBand
    liqPoint = Average(Close, 50)
    If liqPoint is above the upBand, we will liquidate a long position if
    today's market action <= liqPoint
    If liqPoint is below the dnBand, we will liquidate a short position
    if today's market action >= liqPoint
    If we are not stopped out today, then liqLength = liqLength - 1
    If we are stopped out today, then reset liqLength to fifty
Bollinger Bandit Program
    {Bollinger Bandit by George Pruittâ€”program uses Bollinger Bands and Rate of
    change to determine entry points. A trailing stop that is proportional with
    the amount of time a trade is on is used as the exit technique.}
